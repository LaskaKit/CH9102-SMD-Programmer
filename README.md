# Miniature programmer for (not only) LaskaKit development kits

Our LaskaKit development kits with ESP32 are really popular. Especially due to their own low power consumption in the range of uA. But not everyone needs a board this power-efficient - and just for these DIYers we have the miniature CH9102 SMD programmer, which you simply connect to the bottom of one of our development kits and have a programmer right on the board.

Not all kits support this option yet, so please check if the board you want to buy and want to solder this programmer also has this option. We are adding this feature slowly to new revisions of existing boards.

If you still want to have the most power-efficient ESP32 board possible, you can still use it for programming, for example https://www.laskakit.cz/laskakit-ch9102-programmer-usb-c--microusb--uart/.

The advantage of using this SMD programmer is easy board uploading, you don't have to find its bigger brother - https://www.laskakit.cz/laskakit-ch9102-programmer-usb-c--microusb--uart/

The disadvantage is higher power consumption, because the programmer is powered from the development kit itself, but this may not always be a problem.
